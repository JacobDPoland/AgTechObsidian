LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technology that uses laser beams to measure distances and create detailed 3D models of an environment

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique that uses radar waves to capture images of the Earth's surface.

Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Types of Resolutions:
- Spatial: Smallest object observed on the ground
- Spectral: Number of bands or channels that a sensor can detect
	- RGB is 3 bands
	- + infrared would be 4
- Radiometric: sensitivity of the radiation measurement
- Temporal: how frequent the same place is observed

Sensors in order of low to high spatial resolution:
1. Sentinel
2. Planet Scope
3. Planet SKYSAT
4. Phantom 4 RTK UAV
   
Sources of satellite data
- Earthdata - NASA
- Earth Explorer - UAGS

## After lunch
Project: Multi-Source Data Integration for Assessing Crop Water Stress and Irrigation Scheduling
Goals:
- Identify crop water stress
- Calculate crop water needs
- Develop a website or app that combines the three data sources

Data Sources:
 - A UAS equipped with MicaSense Altum PT (RGB, NIR, and Thermal)
 - Soil moisture sensors at different depths
 - Weather station data via TEXMESONET

Soil sensor and Yellow box:
- Yellow box is expensive
- Data point every 15 minutes
- Yellow box also allows for data download over physical connection

## After Crop Tour

Georeferencing uses GPS and black/white squares to establish a common coordinate system. 

RTK stands for real-time kinematic.
One inch of allowed positioning error.

SFM creates 3d model out of 2d images
RTN stands for real-time network
