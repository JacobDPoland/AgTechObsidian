‚≠êMr. Jose Landivar has an agenda this week that will be helpful for updating the website
## Morning: Mission Planning
### Intro slide
- Introduction
- Key components
	- Payload
	- Flight path
	- Navigation
	- Communication
	- Environmental considerations
- Importance
	- Safety
	- Efficiency (flight time / batter power conservation)
		- Reduce the amount of turns
	- Helps ensure success
- Overview: comprehensive introduction to
	- The key concepts
	- Principles
	- Best practices

### Flight Height Considerations
- Flight height is crucial in determining quality and accuracy of data
- Relevant factors to safety:
	- image resolution
	- terrain
	- potential obstacles
- 400 ft (120 meters) is max fly height permitted by FAA for small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS)

### Image Overlap
- Overlap between adjacent images
- Image overlap impacts the quality and coverage of the the final image dataset
- Factors that impact overlap:
	- Altitude
	- Speed
	- Camera specs
	- Mission parameters
- Benefits of optimal overlap (70-85%)
	- Ensures seamless image stitching
	- Improved 3d model reconstruction
	- Better overall image quality and coverage

### Flight Speed
- Impacted factors
	- Image quality
	- Battery life
	- Data collection efficiency
- Factors that affect flight speed
	- Wind conditions
	- Terrain
	- Camera resolution
	- Battery capacity
	- Data transmission requirements
- Goal: be efficient with the drone, but have sufficient image quality
- Battery considerations: 
	- Drone will attempt to return to launch point (home) at 20% batter capacity. 
	- Change batteries before 20%

### Area of Interest (AOI)
- Area of the mission
- Informs the UAV's __ to ensure mission objectives:
	- Flight path,
	- Sensor configuration, and
	- Data collection strategies

### Weather Considerations
- Wind conditions
- Temperature extremes (above 110 degrees F or 100 degrees for an extended flight time)
- Precipitation
- Cloud cover (can obstruct GPS signals)

## UAV Data Collection Procedures

 Importance of Data Collection Protocol
 - Improves data collection
 - Ensures high quality data is collected
 - Helps standardize data throughout the cropping season and across locations
 - Improves the accuracy

Key factors to consider:
- Equipment updated
- Flight overlap 70-85%
- Solar noon
- 5 foot buffer area

We used MicaSense Altum PT
7 bands
Thermal is # 6
