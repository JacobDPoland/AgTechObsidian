# Structure from motion and photogrammetry (SfM)

## What is SfM?
- Photogrammetric technique used to generate 3d models from a series of 2d images

## Key steps- Image Capture
- Image Capture
- Feature extraction
- Camera calibration
- Bundle adjustment
- 3d reconstruction

## SfM Workflow
1. Image capture
2. Image processing
3. Point cloud generation (LiDAR gives this)
4. 3d model generation

## Applications of SfM and Photogrammetry
- 3d modeling of buildings, landscapes, and objects
- Archaeology
- Surveying and mapping
- Industrial inspection and reverse engineering
- Urban planning
- Conservation

## Advantages of SfM
- Low cost data acquisition
- Flexible and adaptive workflow
- Accurate and detailed models
