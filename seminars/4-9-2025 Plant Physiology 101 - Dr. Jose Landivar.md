The speaker *really* wants us to know that crops are like solar panels.

Plants need to transpire (sweat per se) in order to cool off. This is called evapotranspiration.

Plants exchange gas with stomata. There are about 250 stomata per square mm of a leaf.

Solar energy efficiency compared to plant across growing season:

RUE = Radiation use efficiency
- The relationship between the accumulation of biomass relative to the light intercepted by the crop
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5

Canopy measurment:
![[Pasted image 20250409093851.png]]
To get canopy height:
- Must have Digital Elevation Model and Digital Surface Model
- Essentially the height of the ground and the height of the plants
To get canopy cover:
- Go grid by grid and count the number of green pixels
- Green pixels become white and everything else becomes black
The canopy volume is the canopy height multiplied by the canopy cover.

Canopy cover multiplied by ExG (Amount of green) produces yield:

The plants absorb blue and red light the best (green is reflected of course).

The multiple spectrum cameras measure near infrared wavelengths.

ExG (Excess Green) and NDVI explanation:
![[Pasted image 20250409094633.png]]
NDVI = the ratio of NIR to regular red light
