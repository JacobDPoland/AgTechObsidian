Production questions
1. What are issues facing producers regarding irrigation in limited water or rainfed production systems
	1. When to start?
	2. How much to apply -> How much went into the soil (irrigation efficiency)
	3. When to apply? -> How did the crop respond?
2. What approaches are currently used?
	1. Calendar method - start irrigating on July 1 and stop on October 1
	2. ON/OFF - If I don't have enough water to produce a fully irrigated crop, the only thing I can do is turn the system on at some point and turn it off at the end of the season
	3. Model-based approaches - ET
	4. In-field sensors
3. Are there cost-effective technologies that are currently available to producers.

Research Questions
1. How can I quantify location-to-location, site-to-site and year-to-year variability?
	1. ⭐ Bullet points to fill in
2. Am I using relevant irrigation intervals and amounts?
3. Tillage and cover crop effects on inter-season water use, infiltration, moisture holding capacity
4. Anchor points for germplasm screening (data from check varieties)

Broad categories of Scheduling Approaches
- Predictive
	- Calendar
	- Weather calculations, e.g. Evapotranspiration (ET)
- Reactive
	- Human observation
	- Soil moisture sensor
	- Plant sensor
- Hybrid approach uses both approaches

Measuring Soil Moisture
1. Direct Methods
	- Measure the moisture content in the soil
	- Gravimetric - weight difference between wet and dry soil (take soil cores, weigh it, dry it, weigh it again)
	- Volumetric - ratio of water per unit volume of soil (need to know bulk density of the soil)
2. Indirect Methods
	- measure water potential conductivity, stress, or tension in the water held in the soil
	- Neutron probes - uses radioactive source and detector to measure speed of neutron movement; hydrogen in water slows neutrons movement which can be measured with the detector (gold standard, but expensive and makes radioactive waste)
	- Gypsum blocks/Watermark sensors - measure conductivity of electrical signal between 2 electrodes embedded in a porous block; the wetter the soil, the less resistance between the probes (is electroplating an issue?)
	- Capacitance probes - measures changes in oscillating current; the frequency of the oscillation changes as the soil moisture changes 
	- Tensiometers - measures tension on a water column; as soil dries, water leaves a the through a porous cap and pulls a vacuum in the tube which is measured

More on Watermark sensors:
- electrical resistance between electrodes inside a manufactured sand matrix that exhanges water with the surrounding soil
- Cost is about $25, rather cheap
- Accurate information
- Durable
- About 3 inch radius of measurement
- Provides information on rooting depth, infiltration, and extraction

![[Pasted image 20250416094451.png]]
^More on Capacitance Probes
- Oscillating frequency of an electrical circuit where the surrounding soil is part of the dielectric medium for the capacitor in this circuit
- More expensive than water mark, but measures multiple depths down to 1-2 meters in 10cm increments
- Very durable
- Provides information on rooting depth, infiltration, extraction
- Costs bout $400, but is comparable in price to watermarks because it replaces multiple watermark sensors.
- Requires some calibration to soil properties

More on Plant sensors 
- Direct measure of the plant parameter that changes with plant water status
	- Stem/leaf water potential
	- Stem diameter or leaf turgor
	- **Canopy temperature**
- Provides information on plant stress and response to water
- Response is very rapid (< 1h, around 15 to 20 min)
- Can be used in a quantitative approach to prevent or manage stress
- Algorithms relating parameters ... ⭐(fill in notes)

Canopy Temperature and Crop water use - How does it work?
- Plant canopy temperature (CT) is a function of evaporative cooling of the leaves via transpiration
- Optimal transpiration rates occur under optimal plant water status and cool the crop canopy to an optimal temperature. As an example, the optimal temperature is 28C
- The crop's ability to cool itself depends on
	1. Plant capacity to move water - root depth and lateral growth, ⭐(look up) xylem structure
	2. Soil moisture content - soil type, salts, physical barriers (compaction, slope)
	3. Environmental demand - temperature, humidity, light intensity
- During the day, any factor that resulsts in decreased transpiration... ⭐(fill in)

The above graph shows that the roots go up to 60cm or 24inches. Mr. Payton said that they usually don't want to irrigate until roots are 20 inches deep in order to be efficient with water.

Mr. Payton suggests flying in the afternoon in order to notice irrigation differences, but Mahendra noted that it gets very windy in the afternoon.
