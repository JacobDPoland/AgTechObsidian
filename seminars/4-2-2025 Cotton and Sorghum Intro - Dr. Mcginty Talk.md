What is growing in the Coastal Bend and why?
![[Pasted image 20250402090853.png]]
Coastal Bend is dry or rain fed. Sometimes the rotating irrigation machines are used, but they need very deep wells, and that water is still very salty.

RGV has an irrigation problem. U.S. would have to work with Mexico to work that out.

Upper golf coast has more flexibility because they have more rainfall.

Wintergarden uses a lot of irrigation and can grow peanuts.

*As population rises, water supplies are spread thin.*

Main crops grown in the 4 above regions:
- Big three: cotton, Corn, grain sorghum
- More sorghum is grown in the coastal bend
- Small but significant: rice and soybeans (upper gulf), wheat (wintergarden)
- Small acreage, but often present: peanut, sesame, sunflower, peas, oat
- Sesame grows well in the coastal bend, but it isn't very profitable.

El Nino and La Nina predictions heavily impacts species selection.

A *lot* of cotton is grown and manufactured in the coastal bend.
Upper golf coast grows a lot of rice which is possible by using irrigation from the Colorado river. Rice farmers up there have recently started to tap their own wells.

Weather pattern:
- bimodal pattern to rainfall with peaks in May and September
- Highly influenced by tropical events or lack thereof in Jul to October
- We have a long growing season, but early plantings make best use of spring rainfall while standing a chance to harvest before tropical storms or hurricanes occur.

Hot, dry conditions are good for harvesting.

Controllable factors:
- Variety selections
- Seed quality
- Fertility
- Irrigation
- Disease
- Insect control
- Weed control

Cotton Growth and Development:
- General rotation that is rarely broken: cotton one year and sorghum the next
- Tropical perennial species grown as an annual crop
- Growth driven by heat and water
- Cotton's minimum temperature is 60F and heat can be predicted by heat units
- $($Daily high $+$ daily low$) / 2 - 60$ = daily heat unit accumulation

Hardest part of cotton: getting the plant to "stand." Cool, dry years makes this tough.

Cotton only fruits in favorable conditions, so the placement of the fruit can tell about the plant's history and conditions it experienced.
The branches grow in a spiral/zig-zag pattern and grow about 3 days apart.

You can diagnose a plant's problem by analyzing where and thus when the plant is looking sick. If you know when the plant had a problem, you can look into the conditions of the fruit being aborted. Conditions may include cloudy weather, spraying (pesticides and fertilizer?).

Stages of cotton blooming:

Cotton flower images:

When the flower dries, the cotton fruit and fiber material (lint) forms inside.

Each fiber is a long individual cell that attaches to the seed coat.

? Cotton is used in human nutrition?

Squares are very easy to lose due to stressful conditions. Bowls are harder to lose.

Heat Units for Growth:
- Planting: look for 10/day before planting
- Emergence takes 75 to 100 heat units
- Each new node or true leaf takes 55 heat units
- Matchhead square takes 550 heat units
- First flower takes 1000 heat units
- First open boll takes 1900 heat units
- Coastal bend doesn't really track heat units, but they are critical in cooler areas

"Normal" cotton plant structure:
- 5 to 6 vegetative nodes
- 13-15 fruiting nodes/branches
- 18-22 Mainstem nodes
- At first bloom, every fruiting structure that will produce a boll is already on the plant
- The size of the plant at first bloom determines the yield potential

Cotton Root growth
- Roots grow and develop on "leftover" energy from aboveground
- Pre-bloom root growth expands by energy produced by leaves and as soil moisture allows
- Post-bloom root growth is reduced by energy partitioning to develop bolls
- When plants start blooming, roots stop growing

Cotton farmers need to watch for compaction and remediate it with tilling equipment.
Nitrogen is very water soluble.
We can probe deep into the soil and detect nitrogen to measure root length.


Energy demand:
- Early in the bloom season: carb production need is high, seed and lint demand is low
- Late in the bloom season: carb production is low, seed and lint demand is high (plant will sacrifice itself to fully develop fruit)

Cutout is indicated by white flowers withing 5 nodes of the terminal.
Rain, fertilizer, and weed control beyond cutout doesn't help much.

Harvesting equipment hasn't changed much in the last 100 years. Machines are bigger and a bit fancier, but the mechanisms for harvesting are essentially the same. It seems to be tried and true.
Seed can be used for fuel or livestock.

Grain Sorghum:
- An annual grass (C4 photosynthetic pathwaay)
- Well-adapted to the southern Gulf Coast of Texas
- In higher rainfall regions, corn has better yield potential
- Sorghum is typically planted in late Feb and early March. Harvested in July.
- Sorghum is planted once soil temps reach 55-60 F
- Sorghum takes 85 to 130 days from planting to maturity
- Rainfall timing critical (peak demand at boot stage, approx 50 days after planting, DAP)
- Heat at pollination is not an issue with grain sorghum
- No transgenic traits available
- Most commercial sorghum are hybrids
- Insect, disease, and herbicide tolerance purely through traditional plant breeding
- Sorghum is a very small crop on the national scale compared to corn

Sorghum growth degree units:
- (daily low + daily high) / 2 - 50 = GDU

Sorghum growth stages compared to growth degree units:![[Pasted image 20250402130204.png]]

 Sorghum critical and sensitive stage:
 - Primordial grain head is being formed
 - 30-35 days after emergence, 7-10 leaves

**Fully cover yourself in clothing when working with Sorghum, it is very itchy**
