Refresh data structures and algorithms

Start with machine learning basics.
Predict or classify something

Learn about evaluations
Learn about data pre-processing

Then learn about deep learning and neural networks

Sound processing to evaluate and judge privacy?

Financial fraud detection should not need deep learning because it is resource intensive.

Federated learning:
* Security oriented
* Architecture to run multiple models on multiple devices
* Results are sent to the server instead of user data
* User data stays on their devices
* Aggregation?
